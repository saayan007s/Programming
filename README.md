# Competitive-Programming)

This repository has my template library so that anyone can see it and so that I can access it from anywhere.

The CSES problem set can be found [here](https://cses.fi/problemset/). I have solutions to some of them in this repository (spefically dynamic programming, range queries and tree algorithms).

This is [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

## Plans to finish by mid-November

- [ ] write a well documented readable othello game java
- [ ] write and upload the following from [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com)
  - [ ] [knuth optimisation](https://cp-algorithms.com/dynamic_programming/knuth-optimization.html)
  - [ ] [bridge finding](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bridge-searching.html)
  - [x] [convex hull trick and li chao tree](https://cp-algorithms.com/geometry/convex_hull_trick.html)
  - [ ] [disjoint set union problems](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/disjoint_set_union.html)
- [ ] write solutions to all past [INOI problems](https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC): I have about ten problems left
- [ ] upload solutions to all problems from the [atcoder dp contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks): 1 problem left
