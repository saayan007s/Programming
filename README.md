# Competitive-Programming

This repository has my template library so that anyone can see it and so that I can access it from anywhere.

I have started to uploaded my solutions to problems from problem sets that I have nearly completed.

The CSES problem set is [here](https://cses.fi/problemset/)

This is [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

## Plans to finish by mid-june

- [ ] write a well documented readable othello game java
- [ ] write and upload the following from [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com)
  - [ ] knuth optimisation
  - [ ] bridge finding
  - [x] convex hull trick
  - [ ] disjoint set union problems
- [ ] write solutions to all past [INOI problems](https://www.codechef.com/INOIPRAC): I have about ten problems left
- [ ] upload solutions to all problems from the [atcoder dp contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks): about 10 problems left
